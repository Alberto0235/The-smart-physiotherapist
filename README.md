## 📌 Project Overview

This repository hosts all the files related to the **"The Smart Physiotherapist"** project.

The project focuses on developing an innovative, non-invasive system for **Human Activity Recognition (HAR)** of specific motor activities, primarily aimed at **remote patient monitoring** and assistance in rehabilitation contexts. The system leverages **Ultra-Wideband (UWB) radar sensors** to acquire motion data, which is then processed through an advanced **TinyML (Machine Learning on Edge Devices)** pipeline. The core objective is to achieve high classification accuracy while adhering to the strict memory and processing time constraints of resource-limited Microcontroller Units (MCUs).

## 💡 Methodology and Technical Details

The project methodology is divided into three key phases: acquisition, pre-processing, and classification.

### 1. Recognized Activities
The system was trained to recognize five fundamental movement classes crucial for physiotherapy and rehabilitation:
* **"left arm up"**
* **"right arm up"**
* **"left leg up"**
* **"right leg up"**
* **"still position"** (baseline)

### 2. Data Acquisition and Pre-processing
* **Raw Data:** Acquired using two distinct 3-antenna UWB radar platforms: the **SR250Mate** and an **Infineon sensor**. Raw data is stored as complex-valued spatio-temporal matrices in **NumPy** (`.npy`) files.
* **Custom Python Pipeline:** A dedicated **Python** script transforms the raw radar data into a visual format (grayscale images) optimized for Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). This process includes:
    * Calculating the signal magnitude.
    * Selecting the 40 most relevant "range bins" (corresponding to the subject at 1 meter).
    * Horizontally concatenating specific antenna data streams (e.g., RX0+RX1+RX2 for 120 pixels wide images) to create the final input image.

### 3. Model Development (TinyML)
Neural Network models were trained and optimized for efficient inference on edge devices. The work includes a comparative analysis, confirming the superior performance achieved with the Infineon sensor.

| Dataset Used | Final Accuracy (Test) | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Infineon (RX0+RX1+RX2) | **97.03%** | **Best Performing Model.** Confirms the superior data quality of the Infineon sensor and the added value of the third antenna stream. |
| Infineon (RX0+RX1) | 94.12% | Excellent accuracy, but slightly lower than the full 3-antenna dataset. |
| SR250Mate (All Sets) | 10.89% - 16.83% | Significantly lower performance, attributed to the sensor's intrinsically lower Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR). |
